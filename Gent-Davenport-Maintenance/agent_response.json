All items list the specific checks or actions and cite the source of that information.\n\n1) Likely causes (in order of likelihood from the documents)\n1.1 Tooling problems: wrong tool, off\u2011center, dull or improperly honed tool, or tool/holder not firmly mounted [ref_id:0][ref_id:0].\n1.2 Machine cams / cam rolls: flat spots or damaged cam rolls/cam components that create sudden diameter/length change or vibration [ref_id:2][ref_id:6].\n1.3 Feed finger / loose feed finger or pad causing poor feed and vibration [ref_id:8][ref_id:10].\n1.4 Bar stock problems: wrong size/type, bent/twisted/rusty/dirty bars, or bars vibrating in stock reels/tubes [ref_id:0][ref_id:2][ref_id:7].\n1.5 Incorrect feed and speed gears or incorrect cams installed on slides [ref_id:7][ref_id:0].\n1.6 Machine mounting or external vibration sources (machine not secured to floor or shop vibrations) [ref_id:7][ref_id:0].\n1.7 Collet grip/tension or collet not opening fully during feed stroke [ref_id:2].\n1.8 Spindle bearing wear or broken/chipped parts (symptoms described in inspection checks for cam rolls, chuck levers, and bearings) \u2014 requires inspection for rolling freely, flat spots, broken levers/pins [ref_id:6][ref_id:3][ref_id:9].\n\n2) Troubleshooting steps (actionable, numbered)\nNote: follow lockout/tagout and safe machine stopping before performing checks.\n\nStep 1 \u2014 Verify if chatter is from a single tool or all spindles\n1. Make samples from each spindle to determine whether all spindles show chatter or only one position; make five workpieces, one from each spindle, and gauge them [ref_id:2][ref_id:10].\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Quick tooling checks (most common causes)\n2.1 Identify the tool that made the chatter marks if possible; if not identifiable, return to broader checks (page references) [ref_id:0][ref_id:7].\n2.2 Confirm correct tool per setup document; if not, install correct tool [ref_id:0].\n2.3 Check tool centering; center tool per procedure in training/lesson material [ref_id:0].\n2.4 Inspect tool condition: sharpness and hone; remove, sharpen, hone properly or replace if dull or improperly honed [ref_id:0].\n2.5 Ensure tool is firmly mounted in holder; remove, clean and remount, check dovetail fit and holder condition [ref_id:0].\n2.6 If chatter is caused by a drill at that position, rotate the drill 90\u00b0 or change the drill [ref_id:0].\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Tool holder and slide checks\n3.1 Check tool holder fastening to the slide; remove, clean and remount if loose [ref_id:0].\n3.2 Verify the correct cam is installed on the slide; check documentation and install the correct cam if wrong [ref_id:0].\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Cam roll and cam related vibration checks\n4.1 Jog machine to half index (3 o\u2019clock) on the bearing spindle opening/closing cam to inspect cam rolls and pins (disengage starting clutch before manual checks) [ref_id:6].\n4.2 Manually lift cam lever and reach under cam lever to determine if the cam roll turns freely and check for flat spots; flat spots or rolls that do not turn freely indicate a cam roll or pin problem and require replacement/repair [ref_id:1][ref_id:6].\n4.3 If sudden diameter/length change occurs, check the respective cam roll immediately [ref_id:6].\n4.4 If cam rolls/rollers or pins are broken or have flat spots, replace roll(s) and pins and check cam components; call maintenance if parts are broken [ref_id:3][ref_id:6].\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Feed finger and stock feed checks\n5.1 While stocking, check feed finger condition and tension: use cam lever handle and move the feed lever with the feed lever roll throwout disengaged; if stock slides easily through the feed finger with little resistance, check feed finger tension and bar stock size [ref_id:8][ref_id:10].\n5.2 Replace or adjust feed finger or pad if loose or worn [ref_id:8].\n5.3 Check if bars are vibrating in stock reel tubes; secure stock with correct tube liners or install pusher spools if necessary [ref_id:7].\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Bar stock and collet checks\n6.1 Confirm bar stock size/type and straightness; if incorrect or bent, remove and install correct bar stock and reset collet tension [ref_id:0][ref_id:2].\n6.2 Sample parts from each spindle to isolate a bad spindle, check collet grip and tension, ensure collet opens fully during feed stroke; reset collet tension or clean/replace collets/spindles as needed [ref_id:2].\n\nStep 7 \u2014 Machine gear, mounting, and external vibration\n7.1 Verify correct feed and speed gears installed; if incorrect, change them [ref_id:7].\n7.2 Confirm machine is securely mounted to floor; if not, notify maintenance to secure machine [ref_id:7].\n7.3 Check for external vibration sources in the shop or outside; eliminate external sources where possible [ref_id:0][ref_id:7].\n\nStep 8 \u2014 If problem persists\n8.1 After the preceding checks are Yes/OK, check for external sources of vibration within/outside the shop. If still unresolved, notify supervisor or maintenance [ref_id:0][ref_id:7].\n\n3) Inspection procedures and observable symptoms\n3.1 Cam roll / cam inspection (video procedure)\n- Jog machine to half index (3 o\u2019clock) on the cam slot, disengage starting clutch, insert cam lever handle and lift cam lever, then reach under and check that roll turns freely and has no flat spots; flat spots or non\u2011turning indicate faulty roll/pin [ref_id:6][ref_id:1].\n- If a roll turns freely and has no flat spots, the machine can be run; if not, replace or repair and call maintenance when broken [ref_id:1][ref_id:3].\n\n3.2 Chuck lever / pin inspection\n- While stocking, open chuck and manually turn hand wheel to inspect chuck levers; a broken chuck lever will not move when pressure is applied \u2014 replace both levers if broken and call maintenance [ref_id:3].\n\n3.3 Feed finger inspection\n- With feed lever throwout disengaged, move feed lever back and forth using cam lever handle to confirm feed finger engagement and tension; stock sliding easily indicates loose fingers or incorrect stock size [ref_id:8][ref_id:10].\n\n3.4 Workpiece sampling\n- Make one workpiece from each spindle and gauge to identify whether the error is universal or isolated to a spindle [ref_id:10][ref_id:2].\n\n4) Preventive maintenance actions (from training transcripts)\n4.1 Check cam rolls and pins whenever cams are changed and after any sudden diameter or length change [ref_id:6].\n4.2 During stocking, check for loose feed fingers, broken chuck levers or pins, chuck tension, and starting clutch tension [ref_id:8].\n4.3 Remove chips and keep cam areas clean to avoid build\u2011up that may affect cam/roll operation [ref_id:6].\n4.4 Replace worn feed fingers or pads and maintain proper feed finger tension [ref_id:8].\n\n5) Corrective actions (stepwise)\n5.1 Tool corrections: install correct tool, center it, sharpen/hone or replace as required, and ensure holder dovetail and clamping collar are clean and tightened [ref_id:0][ref_id:4][ref_id:0].\n5.2 Cam roll / cam corrections: remove and replace cam rolls/pins with flat spots or broken parts; when removing holders (example E2763\u201110) follow the half\u2011index removal procedure (loosen clamping collar bolt and pull holder out at half index) to service components [ref_id:6][ref_id:9].\n5.3 Feed finger corrections: adjust or replace feed finger or pad; check and set correct feed finger tension [ref_id:8].\n5.4 Bar stock corrections: remove incorrect or damaged bars and install correct size/type; reset collet tension and clean/replace collets as needed [ref_id:0][ref_id:2].\n5.5 Mechanical/installation corrections: install correct feed/speed gears and cams, secure machine to floor, and fix any external vibration sources; call maintenance if structural or broken components are found [ref_id:7][ref_id:0].\n\n6) Spindle bearing wear symptoms and checks (what is available in the sources)\n- The retrieved content directs checking cam rolls, pins, and related components for free rotation and flat spots; while specific bearing measurement limits are not provided in the retrieved documents, symptoms of problems include rolls not turning freely, flat spots, broken pins/levers, and sudden diameter/length changes that indicate cam or related component failure [ref_id:6][ref_id:1][ref_id:3].\n- For bearing/shaft removal or replacement tasks (related component work), follow the documented disassembly sequences (example: removing threading shaft without removing pulley uses ordered removal of pins, bushings, gears, spacers, thrust plate and careful drift of bearing toward belt housing) when required for deeper bearing work [ref_id:5].\n\n7) Safety notes and warnings\n- Always disengage the starting clutch and stop/jog the machine to the correct index (half index / 3 o\u2019clock) before reaching under the cam lever or performing manual roll checks [ref_id:6][ref_id:1].\n- If broken structural parts (cam rolls, pins, chuck levers) are found, call maintenance and do not run the machine [ref_id:3][ref_id:6].\n- Use appropriate lockout/tagout and follow facility safety procedures before performing inspections or repairs (implied by instructions to disengage clutch and call maintenance) [ref_id:6][ref_id:3].\n\n8) Gaps / needs for additional investigation\n- The retrieved material does not include specific numeric acceptance limits for spindle bearing play, vibration amplitude tolerances, or torque/spec values for collet tension and fasteners; obtain manufacturer service manuals or engineering specifications for numeric limits and torque specs before replacing bearings or setting tolerances [ref_id:5][ref_id:4].\n\nSources and timestamps\n- Troubleshooting flowchart \u2014 Chatter on all parts (Page 4) and follow\u2011ups: describes tooling checks, cam/cam\u2011slide checks, collet and stock checks [ref_id:0].\n- Troubleshooting flowchart \u2014 Chatter on all parts when single tool cannot be identified (Page 5): feed/speed gears, machine mounting, bars vibrating in stock reel, return to page 4 and external vibration check [ref_id:7].\n- Workpiece length troubleshooting and collet/stock procedures (Page 6): sampling spindles, collet grip/tension, feed/pusher checks and corrective actions [ref_id:2].\n- Video training segments: cam roll and pin inspection procedure, jogging to half index and disengaging starting clutch, checking for flat spots and free rolling of cam rolls (timestamps: segment covering ~09:47\u201310:26 and related frames) [ref_id:6][ref_id:1].\n- Video training: broken chuck lever inspection and replacement guidance (segment ~05:22\u201307:12) [ref_id:3].\n- Technical tips / installation notes (example procedures for removing/installing parts and shaft service) for deeper disassembly tasks [ref_id:5][ref_id:4].\n\nIf you want, I can convert these into a one\u2011page laminated troubleshooting checklist organized by symptom and the exact sequence of steps to follow at the machine.\n\u30107:1\u2020source\u3011\n{\r\n  \"uid\": \"2ae2234d6a91_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGo2bHc3dnN3aG5uaHcuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L3Ryb3VibGVzaG9vdGluZy9NYXN0ZXJUYXNrJTIwVHJvdWJsZXNob290aW5nJTIwQWxnb3JpdGhtLnBkZg2_normalized_images_3\",\r\n  \"blob_url\": \"https://stj6lw7vswhnnhw.blob.core.windows.net/troubleshooting/MasterTask%20Troubleshooting%20Algorithm.pdf\",\r\n  \"snippet\": \"The image is a one-page troubleshooting flowchart (page 4, copyright V\\u2011TIP, Inc. 1992) for diagnosing \\u201Cchatter\\u201D that appears on all parts from all spindles.

with preventive maintenance during stocking of the Davenport. It demonstrates checking for loose feed fingers on each work spindle using the cam lever handle and feed lever. The process involves moving the lever back and forth with the feed lever roll throwout disengaged. If the stock slides easily, the feed finger tension and bar stock size should be checked. The feed finger or pad may need replacement or adjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscript\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\r\\nWEBVTT\\r\\n\\r\\n04:14.960 --\\u003E 04:17.600\\r\\n\\u003CSpeaker 1\\u003EPreventative maintenance when stocking the Davenport.\\r\\n\\r\\n04:20.160 --\\u003E 04:32.960\"\r\n}\n\u30107:10\u2020source\u3011\n{\r\n  \"uid\": \"cf6062961f85_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGo2bHc3dnN3aG5uaHcuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L3RlY2huaWNhbC10aXBzL1RULTUwODAtMzQtMS1pbnN0YWxsYXRpb24tbG9jYXRpbmctbGV2ZXIucGRm0_normalized_images_0\",\r\n  \"blob_url\": \"https://stj6lw7vswhnnhw.blob.core.windows.net/technical-tips/TT-5080-34-1-installation-locating-lever.pdf\",\r\n  \"snippet\": \"The image is a single-page technical instruction sheet titled, centered at the top, \\u0022INSTALLATION OF LOCATING LEVER (5080-34-1)\\u0022.

Make 5 sample parts (one per spindle) to see if chatter is on one spindle or all (isolate problem)  \n2. Inspect tooling: verify correct tool, center it, sharpen/hone or replace, and firmly remount holder/dovetail  \n3. Check tool holder/slide: tighten clamping collar, verify gib adjustment and correct cam on slide  \n4. Inspect cam rolls/pins: jog to half\u2011index, disengage starting clutch, lift cam lever and feel roll for free rotation/flat spots (replace if faulty)  \n5. Check feed fingers while stocking: move feed lever with throwout disengaged\u2014adjust/replace if stock slides too easily  \n6. Verify bar stock: correct size/straightness, secure in tubes/pusher spools to stop vibration  \n7. Confirm feed/speed gears and machine mounting; eliminate external vibration sources  \n8. If still unresolved, check collet tension/condition and call maintenance for bearings or broken structural parts\n\nSafety note:\n- Disengage starting clutch, lockout/tagout and call maintenance if you find broken cam rolls, pins, or chuck levers\n\nSources:\n- [MasterTask Troubleshooting Algorithm.pdf](https://stj6lw7vswhnnhw.blob.core.windows.net/troubleshooting/MasterTask%20Troubleshooting%20Algorithm.pdf) (Sources: Troubleshooting Guide pages 4\u20136, Video - Preventive Maintenance 10:19\u201310:26; 04:14\u201305:22; End Working Tools 09:41\u201310:12)",
